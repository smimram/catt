# Catt - An infinity-categorical coherence typechecker

Catt is an implementation of a type system for coherence in
[Grothendieck-Maltsiniotis infinity categories](http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2331).

This typechecker is written in OCaml, in the case you would rather like elegant
Haskell, please have a look at [Eric Finster's
implementation](https://github.com/ericfinster/catt/).
